KINGDOM GAME MANUAL

Kingdom is an online text-adventure game with a procedurally generated open world.
The players progress through the game by exploring the game world and trading items with others.

All players are connected to a single game server.
To start playing, you need a compatible client application.

A user has always one being selected that can be changed at any time.

To show details about your user, type:

Read the response and select your initial being by typing:
select <being name>

If you would like to rename your initial being, type:
being name is <being name>

NAVIGATING IN THE GAME WORLD

The game is an open world, composed from modules that are called 'rooms'.
Each being in the game is located in one of these rooms.
A room is connected to one or more of the other rooms.

To show the current room of the selected being, type:
show room

This displays basic information about your surroundings, such as leads to other rooms, items in the room, and what other beings are present.

To move to another room, type:
go <room name>

To take items from the room, type:
take <item name>

If you are playing the game for the first time, try to complete following tasks:
1. Find a room called DEGO TEMPLE and move your being there.
2. Take a look at what items are in the room, and pick them up.

You can quick travel to any global rooms.
This is a useful feature when you want to save time or you feel like being lost.
To display all global rooms, type:
show global rooms

Some rooms have requirements for specific features.
You can only access these rooms with a being that meets these features.
To see the features of the current being, type:
show being

INVENTORY

To display your inventory, type:
show inventory

Each being has two inventories: a free inventory and a trade inventory.
The free inventory is used for anything but trading.
When you start to trade, the items in question are automatically reserved for that purpose and moved to the trade inventory.

TRADING ITEMS

Your selected being can trade items with other beings.
The game does not have traditional money.
Instead, you trade items with other beings by typing:
trade <number> <item name to sell> for <number> <item name to buy>
If a matching offer is found in the current room, the transaction will be resolved and the items will be transferred between the beings.
If a matching offer is not found, the items will be transferred to a trade inventory waiting for a matching offer.
A transaction can be resolved only when the items and quantities in a new offer have to match an existing offer.

For example, offers A and B will match:
Offer A: [1] provisions for [2] ceremonial incense
Offer B: [2] ceremonial incense for [1] provisions

Another example, offers C and D will not match:
Offer C: [1] provisions for [2] ceremonial incense
Offer D: [1] ceremonial incense for [1] provisions

Try to complete following tasks:
1. Find a room called DEGO BAZAAR and move your being there.
2. Read the offers in the room.
3. Sell some ceremonial incenses for provisions.

To give items to another being, type:
give <number> <item name> to <being name>

EXPLORING

The game is a procedurally generated open world that uses a concept called 'curiosity'.
When a player finds a room that contains a curiosity, it can be explored by typing:
explore

This will generate a new room that will be connected to the current room.

Some curiosities have a fee item.
You must have at least one piece of this item, which will be removed from the being's inventory when exploring.

Try to complete following tasks:
1. Find a room called JUNGLE BIOME and move your being there.
2. Search the jungle until you find a room that has a curiosity. Pick up any items you find while doing this.
3. Explore the room to generate an expansion room.

ITEMS:

To display all items in the game, type:
show items

To display details of an item, type:
show item <item name>

Some items are made of other items.
In this case, you can break an item to receive it's components by typing:
break <item name>

To reverse the previous step, an item can be crafted by typing:
craft <item name>

DEPLOYING:

Some items can be deployed to generate new beings.
To deploy an item to a being, type:
deploy <item name>

Try to complete following tasks:
1. Read FRIGATE KIT's description to see what it's made of.
2. Acquire the components by crafting and trading in DEGO JUNKYARD.
3. Craft FRIGATE KIT.
4. Move to DEGO PORT and deploy the frigate.
5. If you have some, give all of your SPACE PROBE -items to the frigate.

The frigate has an inside room.
